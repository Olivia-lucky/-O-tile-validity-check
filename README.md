# O-tile validity check
This tool will try to help you check whether a tile structure with $s$-tiles in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m$ is an O-tile structrue.


## Required:
- CodeBlocks or Visual Studio 2022


## Run:
- You need to write the tile structure to be checked into a file(\*.txt), and place the file(\*.txt) in the same folder as the program.

- And then compile and run the program directly.


## Others:
- We give some examples here, and you can find these examples in the paper.
