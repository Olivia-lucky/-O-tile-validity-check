# O-tile validity check
This tool will try to help you check whether a tile structure with $s$-tiles in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m$ is an O-tile structrue.


## Required:
- CodeBlocks, Visual Studio 2022 or Dev-C++


## To compile:
- Install gcc (g++) that supports -std=c++11 (only Dev-C++)  
Tools---Compiler Options---General---Add the following commands when calling the compiler: -std=c++11  
Tools---Compiler Options---General---Add the following commands when calling the linker: -static-libgcc


## Run:
- You need to write the tile structure to be checked into a file(\*.txt), and place the file(\*.txt) in the same folder as the program.

- And then compile and run the program directly.


## Others:
- We give some examples here, and you can find these examples in the paper.
